Swagger Docs

To view swagger-docs append swagger-ui/ to the end of the root app.
either http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/ or http://coms-309-055.cs.iastate.edu:8080/swagger-ui/

For JavaDocs:
Our javadocs were made for our backend services. You can open the html files with service in them in the browser.
The other files have javadocs as well, but the services are the main ones with details since controllers have swagger docs.
